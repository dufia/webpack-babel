# Exercising webpack
Serious Front-End Engineer has to know his build tools right? I've spent some time playing with webpack just so I can understand it a bit more.

Bullet points I wanted to tick:

* dev and prod configs
* CSS
    * minfied
    * prefixed
    * Sass
    * styled components
* HTML
    * minified
    * multiple entry points
* JS
    * babel
    * typescript
    * minified
    * mangled
    * code splitting
    * tree shaking
    * React
    * code splitted React
* Also
    * hot module replacement
    * optimised images
    * fonts
    * caching hashes
    * copy static assets
    * webpack-dev-server
    * browserlist
    * linting
